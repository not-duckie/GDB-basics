Basic GDB commands.

Break points:



    b F                     Set a break-point at function F.
    b *A                    Set a break-point at absolute address A
    b N                     Set a break-point at line number N.
    b N:F                   Set a break-point at line number N at file F.



    info b                  Lists break-points.
    cond B cond             Set a condition to a break-point B.
    cond B                  Remove the condition of a break-point B.
    delete B                Delete a break-point B.


Stepping:



    stepi or si             Execute one machine instruction (follows a call).
    step or s               Execute one C-program statement (steps into functions).
    stepi N                 Do N machine instructions.
    nexti or ni             Same as si but execute calls as one instructions.
    next or n               Same as ni but execute functions as one statement.
    bt                      Show names of the stack frames.
    up                      Go up one stack frame.
    down                    Go down one stack frame.


Examining:



    info reg                List contents of registers.
    p V                     Print contents of a variable V.
    x /CT A                 Examining memory where:
                            C   number of units to display. 
                            T   x hex integer.
                                d dec integer.
                                u unsigned dec integer.
                                o octal integer.
                                c character.
                                s null terminated string.
                                i as machine instruction.
                            A   an absolute address or 
                                $reg pointed by some register.
